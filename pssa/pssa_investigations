Notes on libpssa-1.0.0RC
========================

The version that was actually used in EPDM testing was slightly modified by
me in the past to reduce memory bloat. The bloat was due to the trajectories
being saved in RAM; consequently, emergency-fixing the memory broke the
trajectory output.

Another difference is switching from MONOTONIC clock to CPUTIME_ID, apparently
to get a more precise estimation of CPU run time.

Modified files are available at libpssa-1.0.0RC directory of the present
repository.

--------

Had to deduce the format of the trajectories again and it took a while. Writing
it down this time:

<system state at T=0>
<system state at T=dt>
<system state at T=dt>
<newline>
<system state at T=2*dt>
<system state at T=2*dt>
<newline>
...
<system state at T=n*dt>
<system state at T=n*dt>
<newline>

Here, n is the max number of records. About 80% of the time it is
floor(t_max/dt) and 20% of the time it is floor(t_max/dt)-1. Obvously there is
an off-by-one error somewhere in the record-keeping code, but its nature is
unknown. What is known is that it is not the classical time keeping error with
floating point nonassociativity (a + b - b =/= a, especially if there are many
bs): increasing the simulation time by 10-50% of dt does not fix the problem.

Somehow this problem only affects Homoreaction.sbml but not Heteroreaction.sbml.

The reason for duplicating every line after the first and adding newlines is
also unknown. In any code using these trajectories, the assumption that the
lines come in pairs should be explicitly checked. So far I found no exceptions.

System state is represented as follows:

<n0c0>,<n1c0>,..,<nNc0> <tab symbol> <n0c1>,<n1c1>,..,<nNc1> <tab symbol> ...

where nIcJ is the number of molecules of specie I in compartment J.

--------

Regarding the statistical mode output: see comment at
694-704@libpssa/src/PSSA.cpp. Basically it says that the specie distribution is
the distribution of molecular counts at last time step. This is confirmed by the
experiments: the distribution becomes increasingly skewed toward initial
conditions as tend decreases.
